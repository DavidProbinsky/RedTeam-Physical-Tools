### Commonly used tools for Red Teaming Engagements, Physical Security Assessments, and Tactical Covert Entry.

In this list I decided to share most of the tools I utilize in authorized engagements, including where to find some of them, and in some cases I will also include some other alternative tools. I am not providing information on how to use these tools, since this information can be found online with some research. My goal with this list is to help fellow Red Teamers with a 'checklist', for whenever they might be missing a tool, and use this list as a reference for any engagement. Stay safe and legal!!

Recon Tool   | Where to find | Alternative |
------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
<a name="camera"></a>1. Camera with high zoom | Recommended: [Panasonic Lumix FZ-80 with 60x Zoom Camera](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MS16V42/) | Alternative: If not the Panasonic, you can use others. There are many other good cameras in the market. Try to get one with a decent zoom, any camera with over 30x Optical Zoom should work just fine.

<a name="ba-camera"></a>2. Body Worn Action Camera | Recommended: [GoPro cameras](https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras) or the [DJI Osmo Action cameras](https://www.dji.com/products/handheld-imaging-devices#action-series) | Alternatives: There are other cheaper alternative action cameras that can be used, however the videos may not have the highest quality or best image stabilization, which can make the footage seem wobbly or too dark.
